      "ArticleContent": "<p><b>A </b>A dramatic story about cotton farmers in India shows how destructive pesticides can be for people and the environment; and why today's agriculture is so dependent on pesticides. This story also shows that it's possible to stop using chemical pesticides without losing a crop to ravaging insects, and it explains how to do it. </p>\n<p><b>B </b>The story began about 30 years ago, a handful of families migrated from the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, southeast India, into unukula, a community of around 900 people farming plots of between two and 10 acres. The outsiders from Guntur brought cotton-culture with them. Cotton wooed farmers by promising to bring in more hard cash than the mixed crops they were already growing to eat and sell: millet, sorghum, groundnuts, pigeon peas, mung beans, chilli and rice. But raising cotton meant using pesticides and fertilisers-until then a mystery to the mostly illiterate farmers of the community. When cotton production started spreading through Andhra Pradesh state. The high value of cotton made it an exceptionally attractive crop, but growing cotton required chemical fertilizers and pesticides. As most of the farmers were poor, illiterate, and without previous experience using agricultural chemicals, they were forced to rely on local, small-scale agricultural dealers for advice. The dealers sold them seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides on credit and also guaranteed purchase of their crop. The dealers themselves had little technical knowledge about pesticides. They merely passed on promotional information from multinational chemical companies that supplied their products. </p>\n<p><b>C </b>At first, cotton yields were high, and expenses for pesticides were low because cotton pests had not yet moved in. The farmers had never earned so much! But within a few years, cotton pests like bollworms and aphids plagued the fields, and the farmers saw how rapid insect evolution can be. Repeated spraying killed off the weaker pests, but left the ones most resistant to pesticides to multiply. As pesticide resistance mounted, the farmers had to apply more and more of the pesticides to get the same results. At the same time, the pesticides killed off birds, wasps, beetles, spiders, and other predators that had once provided natural control of pest insects. Without these predators, the pests could destroy the entire crop if pesticides were not used. Eventually, farmers were mixing pesticide \"cocktails\" containing as many as ten different brands and sometimes having to spray their cotton as frequently as two times a week. </p>\n<p><b>D </b>The villagers were hesitant, but one of Punukula's village elders decided to risk trying the natural methods instead of pesticides. His son had collapsed with acute pesticide poisoning and survived but the hospital bill was staggering. SECURE's staff coached this villager on how to protect his cotton crop by using a toolkit of natural methods chat India's Center for Sustainable Agriculture put together in collaboration with scientists at Andhra Pradesh's state university. They called the toolkit \"Non-Pesticide management\"-or \"NPM\". </p>\n<p><b>E </b>The most important resource in the npm toolkit was the neem tree (Azadirachta indica) which is common throughout much of India. Neem tree is a broad-leaved evergreen tree related to mahogany. It protects itself against insects by producing a multitude of natural pesticides that work in a variety of ways: with an arsenal of chemical defenses that repel egg-laying, interfere with insect growth, and most important, disrupt the ability of crop-eating insects to sense their food. </p>\n<p><b>F </b> In fact, neem has been used traditionally in India to protect stored grains from insects and to produce soaps, skin lotions, and other health products. To protect crops from insects, neem seeds are simply ground into a powder that is soaked overnight in water. The solution is then sprayed onto the crop. Another preparation, neem cake, can be mixed into the soil to kill pests and diseases in the soil, and it doubles as an organic fertiliser high in nitrogen. Neem trees grow locally, so the only \"cost\" is the labor to prepare neem for application to fields. </p>\n<p><b>G </b> The first farmer's trial with NPM was a complete success！His harvest was as good as the harvests of farmers that were using pesticides, and he earned much more because he did not spend a single rupee on pesticides aspired by this success, 20 farmers tried NPM the next year. SECURE posted two well-trained staff in Punukula to teach and help everyone in the village, and the village women put pressure on their husbands to stop using toxic chemicals. Families that were no longer exposing themselves to pesticides began to feel much better and the rapid improvements in income, health, and general wellbeing quickly sold everyone on the value NPM. By 2000, all the farmers in Punukula were using NPM, not only for cotton, but for their other crops as well. </p>\n<p><b>H </b> The suicide epidemic came to an end. And with the cash, health, and energy that returned when they stopped poisoning themselves wit pesticides, the villagers were inspired to start more community and business projects. The women of Punukula created a new source of income by collecting, grinding, and selling neem seeds for NPM in other villages. The villagers rescued their indentured children and gave them special six-month \"catch-up\", courses to return to school.</p>\n<p><b>I</b> Fighting against pesticides, and winning, increased village solidarity, self-confidence, and optimism about the future. When dealers tried to punish NPM users by paying less for NPM cotton, the farmers united to form a marketing cooperative that found fairer prices elsewhere. The leadership and collaboration skills that the citizens of Punukula developed in the NPM struggle have helped them to take on other challenges, like water purification, building a cotton gin to add value to the cotton before they sell it, and convincing the state government to support NPM over the objection of multi-national pesticide corporations. </p>\n",
      "ArticleTranslate": "<p><b>A </b>一个关于印度棉农的戏剧性故事展示了农药对人类和环境的破坏性；以及为什么今天的农业如此依赖农药。这个故事还表明，停止使用化学杀虫剂是有可能的，而不会因昆虫的肆虐而损失作物，并解释了如何做到这一点。 </p>\n<p><b>B </b>故事开始于大约 30 年前，少数家庭从印度东南部安得拉邦的 Guntur 区迁移到 unukula，这是一个约有 900 人的社区，耕地面积介于 2 到10 英亩。 Guntur的外来者带来了棉花文化。棉花通过承诺带来比他们已经种植的用于食用和出售的混合作物更多的现金来吸引农民：小米、高粱、落花生、木豆、绿豆、辣椒和大米。但是种植棉花意味着使用杀虫剂和化肥——直到那时对社区中大部分文盲的农民来说都是一个谜。当棉花生产开始在安得拉邦蔓延时。棉花的高价值使其成为一种极具吸引力的作物，但种植棉花需要化肥和杀虫剂。由于大多数农民贫穷、文盲，而且以前没有使用农药的经验，他们被迫依赖当地的小规模农业经销商寻求建议。经销商向他们赊销种子、化肥和杀虫剂，并保证购买他们的作物。经销商本身对农药的技术知识知之甚少。他们只是传递来自供应其产品的跨国化学公司的促销信息。 </p>\n<p><b>C </b>一开始棉花产量高，农药费用低，因为棉花害虫还没有进来。农民从来没有赚到这么多！但在几年之内，棉铃虫和蚜虫等棉花害虫困扰着田地，农民们看到了昆虫进化的速度。反复喷洒杀死了较弱的害虫，但让对杀虫剂最有抵抗力的害虫得以繁殖。随着农药抗药性的增加，农民不得不使用越来越多的农药才能获得相同的结果。与此同时，杀虫剂杀死了鸟类、黄蜂、甲虫、蜘蛛和其他曾经为害虫提供自然控制的捕食者。如果没有这些捕食者，如果不使用杀虫剂，害虫可能会破坏整个作物。最终，农民混合了多达 10 种不同品牌的农药“鸡尾酒”，有时不得不每周喷洒两次棉花。 </p>\n<p><b>D </b>村民们犹豫不决，但普努库拉的一位村长决定冒险尝试自然方法而不是杀虫剂。他的儿子因急性农药中毒昏倒并活了下来，但医院账单令人震惊。 SECURE 的工作人员与印度可持续农业中心与安得拉邦州立大学的科学家合作，使用自然方法聊天工具包指导这位村民如何保护他的棉花作物。他们称该工具包为“非农药管理”或“NPM”。 </p>\n<p><b>E </b>npm 工具包中最重要的资源是印楝树 (Azadirachta indica)，它在印度大部分地区都很常见。楝树是一种与红木有关的阔叶常绿乔木。它通过产生多种以多种方式起作用的天然杀虫剂来保护自己免受昆虫侵害：具有一系列的化学防御，可以排斥产卵，干扰昆虫生长，最重要的是，破坏以农作物为食的昆虫对食物的感知力。 <p><b>F </b> 事实上，印度传统上一直使用印楝来保护储存的谷物免受昆虫侵害，并生产肥皂、润肤露和其他健康产品。为了保护农作物免受昆虫侵害，印楝种子只需磨成粉末，然后在水中浸泡一夜。然后将溶液喷洒在作物上。另一种制剂，印楝饼，可以混入土壤中以杀死土壤中的病虫害，它兼作高氮有机肥。印楝树在当地生长，因此唯一的“成本”是准备印楝以应用于田间的劳动。 </p>\n<p><b>G </b> 第一个农民用 NPM 的试验取得了圆满成功！他的收成和打农药的农民一样好，而且他赚的更多，因为他没有花1卢比。次年，20 名农民尝试使用 NPM 来获得这种成功所渴望的农药。 SECURE 在普努库拉派了两名训练有素的员工来教导和帮助村里的每个人，村里的妇女向她们的丈夫施加压力，要求他们停止使用有毒化学品。不再接触杀虫剂的家庭开始感觉好多了，收入、健康和总体福祉的迅速改善迅速让每个人都喜欢上了价值 NPM。到 2000 年，普努库拉的所有农民都在使用 NPM，不仅用于棉花，还用于其他作物。 </p>\n<p><b>H </b> 自杀式流行告一段落。随着他们停止用杀虫剂毒害自己后所获得的现金、健康和精力，村民们受到鼓舞，开始了更多的社区和商业项目。 Punukula 的妇女通过为其他村庄的 NPM 收集、研磨和销售印楝种子创造了新的收入来源。村民们解救了他们的契约儿童，并给了他们为期六个月的特殊“追赶”课程，让他们重返校园。</p>\n<p><b>I</b> 与农药作斗争并取得胜利，增强了村庄的团结、自信和对未来的乐观。当经销商试图通过减少购买 NPM 棉花的价格来惩罚 NPM 用户时，农民们联合起来组建了一个营销合作社，在其他地方找到了更公平的价格。 Punukula 市民在 NPM 斗争中培养的领导力和协作技能帮助他们应对其他挑战，例如水净化、建造轧棉机以在出售棉花之前为其增值，并说服州政府支持NPM 不顾跨国农药公司的反对。 </p>\n"
